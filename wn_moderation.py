"""Wordnest - AI content review bot.

Two layers check every submission:
  1. Rule check (always on, free): word and pattern lists for adult content, abuse,
     violence, government/politics, illegal activity, personal data and spam.
  2. AI check (Google Gemini, when GEMINI_API_KEY is set): reads the whole piece
     and judges meaning, not just words.

The strictest result wins. Possible decisions:
  pass   - looks safe; goes to an editor (or straight live if auto-publish is on)
  review - needs a human editor to decide
  block  - rejected automatically; the writer sees why and can edit and resubmit
