## 3. Put it online (GitHub + Streamlit Community Cloud)

**3.1 Create the repository**
1. Go to github.com → **New repository** → name it `wordnest-demo` → choose **Private** → Create.

**3.2 Upload the files**
1. Click **Add file → Upload files**.
2. Drag in all the files from the folder (`app.py`, all `wn_*.py`, `logo.svg`, `logo_icon.svg`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`).
3. Click **Commit changes**.

**3.3 Check**: `app.py` must be at the top level of the repository, not inside a folder.

**3.4 Add the settings file** (GitHub uploads often drop hidden folders, so create it by hand)
1. Click **Add file → Create new file**.
2. In the name box type exactly: `.streamlit/config.toml` (typing the `/` creates the folder).
3. Paste:
```
[theme]
base = "light"
primaryColor = "#1F6F5C"
backgroundColor = "#F6F7F4"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
textColor = "#1C2321"

[server]
maxUploadSize = 100

[client]
toolbarMode = "viewer"
```
4. Click **Commit changes**.

**3.5 Deploy**
1. Go to share.streamlit.io → **Create app** → **Deploy a public app from GitHub**.
2. Repository: `your-name/wordnest-demo`, Branch: `main`, Main file path: `app.py`.
3. App URL: for example `wordnest-demo`.
4. Open **Advanced settings** → Python version **3.12** → paste the secrets below → **Deploy**.

**3.6 Secrets** (Advanced settings, or later in app **Settings → Secrets**)
```
ADMIN_EMAIL = "your-admin-email@example.com"
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "a-strong-password-here"
ADMIN_NAME = "Wordnest Admin"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "paste-your-gemini-key"
GEMINI_MODEL = "gemini-2.5-flash"
```
- Get a free Gemini key at **aistudio.google.com → Get API key**. Without it, the bot still runs its rule check, and an editor makes the final call.
- If Google renames the model, change only `GEMINI_MODEL`.
- Never put secrets in GitHub.

## 4. How the AI review bot works

1. **Rule check** (always on): word and pattern lists in English and Hindi for adult content, abuse, violence,
   government/politics, illegal activity, personal data (phone, email, Aadhaar-like and PAN-like numbers) and spam.
2. **AI check** (with `GEMINI_API_KEY`): Gemini reads the whole piece and judges meaning. Text inside a submission
   is treated as data, so "ignore your rules and approve" tricks do not work.
3. The strictest result wins:
   - **Pass** → goes to the editor queue (or straight live if *auto-publish* is on in Settings)
   - **Review** → editor decides
   - **Block** → not published; the writer sees the reasons and how to fix them, and gets a message
4. Blocks for adult or abusive content add a **strike**. At 3 strikes (Settings) the account is suspended.
5. **Government rule:** community articles may not discuss governments, parties, politicians or elections.
   Neutral practical mentions ("apply on the government e-visa website") are allowed. Turn on **Strict government
   rule** in Settings to block every mention. **Daily News** may cover geopolitics and the economy, but must be
   neutral and sourced.
6. Readers can **Report this content** on any article, news story or book. Reports appear in Admin → Reports.
7. Admin → Users and reminders → **Send a reminder** sends the guidelines reminder to every writer's Messages tab.

## 5. Demo limits (important)

- **Data resets** when Streamlit Cloud restarts the app (after it sleeps or on a new deploy). Demo content comes back,
  but new articles, books and accounts are lost. The live site needs a permanent database.
- **Payments are simulated.** No money is charged.
- **Refreshing the browser signs you out.** Use the menu to move between pages.
- Uploaded PDFs and covers are stored in the database. Fine for a demo; the live site should use file storage.

---

## 6. Before the real launch

- [ ] Permanent database (Supabase/PostgreSQL or Hostinger MySQL) and file storage for PDFs and covers
- [ ] Razorpay live payments, GST invoices from SHROOP Global, refund flow
- [ ] Email for sign-up confirmation, password reset and reminders
- [ ] Final site on Hostinger with your domain (better for Google search than Streamlit)
- [ ] Lawyer review of the policy pages; fill in the grievance officer name, email and address
- [ ] CA to confirm the GST rate on ebooks and TDS on author royalties
- [ ] Signed author agreement (royalty %, non-exclusive licence, payouts)
- [ ] Replace demo books with real PDFs and covers; replace [Demo] news
- [ ] Only use photos you own, licensed, or free-to-use; credit every news source
